# What to expect from an Exploration

Often departments approach CDS for help, but it is hard to know how we might best support you without having a better picture of the service opportunity and the delivery conditions and practices in place. By conducting an Exploration, we aim to help you take stock while building our own understanding to inform potential next steps. 

Through discussions with executives, team members and departmental representatives across a variety of functional areas, like policy, IT, program delivery, communications,  legal, and privacy, CDS looks at the existing conditions and practices and the extent to which they enable digital service delivery. CDS uses the following  criteria to inform recommendations to improve digital delivery within a particular service context and opportunity:  



* establishing and empowering multidisciplinary teams; 
* conducting user research to make service design decisions informed by user feedback;
* practicing continuous improvement; 
* working in the open; 
* cultivating a culture of collaboration; and, 
* shifting to a service delivery model (i.e., ensuring prioritization and funding for digital services, including talent development and recruitment and access to modern tools and infrastructure).

This structured look-under-the-hood approach helps us deliver timely, incremental recommendations to your department, and gives us the information we need to inform if and how CDS might continue to partner. This could be, for example, through consulting, an embedded service design and delivery team, or by connecting you to CDS platform services.


# Why Exploration matters

Exploration is important because it sets the foundation for everything that follows. It helps us understand you and your team, the context of your work, as well as your department or agency’s needs. It helps you pause and take stock of where your team and department are at and how you can potentially move forward. The recommendations produced as part of an exploration are meant to be ones you can move forward with on, with or without CDS.

We know that you need to deliver on your mandate, and on operational and legislative commitments. We want to help you get there, and set you up to sustain the product or service once we’re no longer around to help. To do that we need to determine what the best path forward would be for your organization, this may be an embedded team, consulting services or referrals to other organizations that are better positioned to help with your needs. 

As a part of the exploration process, you will be able to sit in on interviews and have conversations with teams around the department that you don’t normally get to interact with. Through these interviews, you may be able to build connections and learn about opportunities within your own department to move your program forward.

At the end of the exploration, we provide our findings as well as some recommendations for next steps. We collaborate with you to prioritize and sort the recommendations based on the unique environment within your department. Through this activity, we also have you identify which recommendations you would like our help with. We take those and share them with our management and head of business development for their consideration on our future project work.


# What’s involved in Exploration

In Exploration, we dedicate a small multidisciplinary team from CDS to listen and learn from you. The goal is to get an understanding of your department or agency’s ways of working. We want to gather as much information as possible about your current situation so that we can work with you to chart the way forward. 

From start to finish, Exploration takes about a month, but this can vary. 



* **Week 1: **Introduction and set-up
* **Week 2: **Discussions with stakeholders
* **Week 3:** Processing and summarizing learnings
* **Week 4:** Presenting and discussing next steps

We estimate the total amount of time required from you during an exploration can vary depending on how much preparation you want to do within your department. Previous explorations have ranged in department time commitment from 18 to 36 hours.


### **Week 1: Introduction and set-up**

Partner time commitment: 4-8 hours

We will work with you to:



* Create a description of the problem space. 
* Identify key stakeholders.
* Schedule meeting times with various stakeholders.  

To prepare for this, consult the

Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[interview topics](#heading=h.fkvwwf2610od) and identify who might be best suited for each meeting.

We will also need you to collect and send as many of the following documents as you have available. Our goals is not for you to draft these documents for the purpose of the exploration:



* High-level organizational chart
* Program documents
    * Business goals and KPIs 
    * Business model 
    * Program evaluations
    * Process maps 
    * Logic models 
    * IT Roadmap 
* Relevant technical or systems diagrams
* Product lifecycle management documentation
* Feedback and personal stories from public users
* Call centre logs and statistics
* Data analytics (existing service)
* Documentation surrounding governance of accessibility improvements 
* Documentation around IT Asset Management or Change Advisory Board process (ideally recent minutes from meetings where they discussed new technologies)
* Any other supporting documentation that explains who the users are, how they are impacted, and why they need help


### **Week 2: Discussing with stakeholders **

Partner time commitment: 8-16 hours (for lead of project), 2 hours for each interview participant (1 hour for kick-off meeting, 1 hour for interview)

We’ll begin the week with a kick-off meeting where we’ll introduce ourselves and CDS, the way we work, and what to expect from Exploration. This meeting will include all the participants from your department, as well as the Exploration team at CDS. 

 \
The rest of the week, we’ll run a series of 1-hour meetings with key stakeholders at your department or agency — from working-level to management and executives. We’ll be looking to learn from people in your department about the following topics:



* Design and direction
* Work methods
* Program design
* Policy
* ATIP/Privacy
* Legal
* IT
* Communications

 \
The daily schedule for the week might look something like this: a stakeholder chat each morning and afternoon (1hr each) . Stakeholder chats usually happen via Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, conference call or whatever technology you’re most comfortable with. 


### **Week 3: Processing and summarizing learnings**

Partner time commitment: 2-4 hours

We’ll take back all that we’ve learned, process the information, and summarize our learnings. This information will be packaged into an output in Week 4. 

During this week there is very minimal involvement required of the department. We may reach out with a clarifying question or two but often this is a quiet week for our partner team.


### **Week 4: Presenting and discussing next steps**

Partner time commitment: 4-8 hours

We’ll share our draft recommendations with you and work together to prioritize and sort them into next steps, most often in a workshop format. Additionally, we gather from you which recommendations you would potentially need assistance and guidance from CDS to implement. We share these potential engagements with our senior leadership and head of business development to inform our planning process.  \


We package all this information into a final output document for you to share within your department as you move forward.
