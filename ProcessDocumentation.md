### The problem: Partnership challenges 

One of the ways that CDS works with departments is through **Partnerships** where we work on a problem space together. But in the 3 years that CDS has existed, our Partnerships have been hard and slow.

Our delivery teams expected to roll up their sleeve and get to work from the get go, but instead ran into blockers. Constraints, such as lengthy and slow approvals, difficulty in getting access to key infrastructure, unexpected legal opinions, fuzzy problem statements and fear of launching something new, have prevented us from building with partners and sharing our work publicly. In some cases it’s even prevented us from taking the final step to go live. 

This lead to a difficult and stressful working environment for delivery teams. They were often treated like vendors rather than partners. Our partnerships had a high potential to fail. And because of that, we aren’t doing a good job delivering on our mandate to change government to serve people better.

What we want is to work with partners who are open and receptive to new ways of working: Where they provide access to the people, information and infrastructure we need. And they’re comfortable with us sharing our work, methodologies and experiences beyond the project space.  

In May of 2020, we launched our work on our **Exploration Service**.


#### Goals of an Exploration 
- **Goal 1:** Explore the partner’s capabilities and readiness to deliver a digital service and provide practical actions to improve.
- **Goal 2:** Determine CDS’ level of involvement.
- **Goal 3:** Understand the government landscape and learn about patterns and trends.
