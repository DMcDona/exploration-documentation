## Why Exploration

### The problem: Partnership challenges 

One of the ways that CDS works with departments is through [Partnerships](https://digital.canada.ca/partnerships/). But in the 3 years that CDS has existed, our Partnerships have been hard and slow. 

Our delivery teams expected to roll up their sleeve and get to work from the get go, but instead ran into blockers. Constraints, such as lengthy and slow approvals, difficulty in getting access to key infrastructure, unexpected legal opinions, fuzzy problem statements and fear of launching something new, have prevented us from building *with* partners and sharing our work publicly. In some cases it’s even prevented us from taking the final step to go live. 

This lead to a difficult and stressful working environment for our delivery teams. They were often treated like vendors rather than partners. Our partnerships had a high potential to fail. And because of that, we weren’t doing a good job delivering on our mandate to change government to serve people better.

What we want is to work with partners who are open and receptive to new ways of working: Where they provide access to the people, information and infrastructure we need, and they’re comfortable with us sharing our work, methodologies and experiences beyond the project space.  

So in May of 2020, we launched our work on our new **Exploration Service** by dedicating a multi-disciplinary team to it. 

### Goals of an Exploration
It's been a long journey to get here, and the goals of the service have changed along the way, but here is where they stand now:  
- **Goal 1:** Explore the partner’s capabilities and readiness to deliver a digital service and provide practical actions to improve.
- **Goal 2:** Determine CDS’ level of involvement.
- **Goal 3:** Understand the government landscape and learn about patterns and trends.

## How we developed the service

### 1. Conducted background research
- Primary research: collected needs from all delivery communities about what makes a good partnership
- Secondary research: reviewed other frameworks such as maturity models, including the USDS Discovery Sprint model which we built our eventual process off of 
- Peer feedback sessions: Ontario Digital Service (ODS), Government Digital Service (GDS) & CodeforCanada (C4C)
- Global lens: Public Digital & Harvard Kennedy School consultations 

### 2. Developed a Theory of Change
- Created a [Theory of Change](https://trello.com/c/IXrBSPhx/1-monitoring-and-evaluation-workshop-from-merlin-chatwin-c4c-and-laura-nelson-hamilton-ods) for the service
- Theory of Change informed an evaluation & monitoring plan 

### 3. Prototyped the framework and the service
- Framework: Created assessment criteria & questions 
- Service: Mapped the Exploration Service model and developed processes & artifacts to support the service

### 4. Created a CDS Intake model 
- Mapped CDS's multiple service lines
- Created a centralized Intake to serve departments coming into our pipeline

### 5. Piloted with 4 departments, iterating between each round
- ESDC Temporary Foreign Worker Program 
- NRCan CanmetENERGY
- NRCan Flood mapping 
- IRCC Refugee Information Needs

## Naming the service: what's in a name? 

The service has evolved immensely, which is reflected in the number of times we've iterated on the name: 

**1. Departmental Assessment** 

The service began as a "vetting" tool, a "go/no go" on whether we would partner with a department. But we found that this name only described the part of the service that was evaluative. It sounded a bit like an exam and introduced a power dynamic between the org doing the assessing (us) and the one being assessed (our partners). 

**2. Pre-Discovery** 

We moved to the term "Pre-Discovery" because it sounded less intimidating and it fit into our "Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live" model of phase patterns, which helped communicate the process. But after running a couple pilots, it became evident that the end might not always lead to a Discovery phase. We learned there's multiple ways of helping a department, and so by calling it a "Pre-Discovery" we weren't managing expectations effectively. We also found that the process had value in and of itself for a partner, and it could exist as its own service. So we decided to separate the name from the "Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live" model.

**3. Exploration** 

The latest iteration, and where we've landed currently is "Exploration". We chose this name because we thought it was more reflective of what we're actually doing. We are Exploring digital service conditions by adapting to a new environment and providing tailored help. In other words we're meeting partners where **they're** at. Failures are okay when exploring and can bring high value and insights as we document and chart a path to build a larger view of the landscape. And even if an Exploration doesn’t lead to a Discovery, there are many useful small discoveries along the way. 

## What is an Exploration? 

We have a couple of hypotheses: 
1. If CDS better understands the existing conditions within a service context then it will be able to better tailor its help to a department, and
2. If enabling conditions and practices are present then teams will deliver better products and services. 

An Exploration is a service we deliver to:
- Understand the existing delivery conditions and practices within a service context;
- Identify ways to introduce digital practices, like conducting user research and practicing continuous improvement;
- Make recommendations on ways to shift conditions to enable those practices, if and where needed;
- Provide advice and practical actions to develop and deliver a product or service – or improve an existing one; and
- Explore how CDS might support a partner on that journey.

An Exploration is comprised of a **framework** we created and a **service** we built on top of it. As we deliver the service, we’re learning and iterating on both, to improve the Exploration experience and the value that comes from participating in and running one.

### Framework: Exploring enabling conditions

To learn about a department's conditions we try to answer these two questions:

*To what extent do digital roles and structures exist?*
- Leadership and coherent direction (coherent policy direction, service priorities and champions)
- Enabling capacity and infrastructure (modern IT infrastructure, legal, comms and privacy guidance and support)
- Delivery capability (talent and teams with digital skills, tactics and tools)
 
*To what extent do digital practices exist?* 
- Shifting to a product delivery model
- Cultivating a culture of collaboration 
- Working in the open 
- Establishing and empowering multi-disciplinary teams 
- Conducting user research 
- Practicing continuous improvement

### Service: Where Explorations live in the CDS service model 

This is the map of our overall CDS service model. To read the boxes more closely, click on the image. 

![Diagram with rectangles. On the left side there's a rectangle labelled "Outreach", which points to "Intake", which then points to 4 different boxes. From top to bottom the boxes are labelled "Partnerships:Embedded Service Design and Delivery", "Partnerships:Exploration", Partnerships: Consulting", "Platform: Notify", "Platform:Forms". Within each of the boxes is there are more boxes showing a process through directional arrows.](https://github.com/cds-snc/exploration-documentation/blob/main/images/Business%20units%20service%20map.png)

Each of the squares represents one of the services that we offer, such as Notify, Forms, Embedded Partnerships etc, with arrows going between all of them, showing how they connect with each other and work together. 

Most services start with our new Intake process on the left side of the map. This is how departments come into the organization, and get triaged to different units depending on their needs. Intake may lead to an Exploration (the second box down on the right side), which in turn may lead to other services within CDS.

Explorations are designed to take approximately 4 weeks, with a set up phase prior to that. The process goes as follows... 

Before Exploration: Set-up 
- Describe the problem space
- Map key stakeholders
- Gather background documents
- Meet with the partner to set up the sprint

Week 1: Internal onboarding 
- CDS team onboarding meeting
- Read partner documentation 
- Review and tailor sprint materials to the partner

Week 2: Gather information 
- Kick off meeting 
- Interviews
- Debriefs
- Scoring

Week 3: Synthesize and present internally 
- Follow up discussions with department
- Analyze findings 
- Create playback report
- Roadmapping exercise with the department 
- Initial feedback from department 
- Present internally for feedback 

Week 4: Iterate and present externally 
- Iterate deck based on feedback 
- Present final report to partner 
- Retro the process

After Exploration: Transition 
- Hand off information internally
- If applicable: offer continued support 

Once everything is said and done, we retro the whole process so we can determine what should be improved for the next time. While this is all happening, our User Researcher is also looking at how the process is working, observing interviews, and running feedback sessions with participants to learn how it went for them. Both of these things inform the next tasks in our backlog. 

## How we iterated upon Explorations

### Research 
Between each pilot, we spent 1 - 2 sprints iterating upon the service based on research findings and team feedback. The goals of these efforts included improving process by iterating on the interview guides and improving the artifacts related to delivering an Exploration. We also used the work to identify and address gaps in the framework.

The work consisted of two research activities, observational study and follow-up discussions, and one team ritual, retros.
- Observational study: The design researcher on the team observed all interviews with the partner as well as team meetings and rituals that took place as a part of the Exploration. The researcher took notes and collated observations from these interviews and team rituals for analysis.
- Follow-up interviews: The design researcher conducted follow-up discussions with people from the partner organisation after the primary Exploration interviews took place. Notes from those discussions were aggregated and analyzed.
- Retros with the team: The project manager held retros after each Exploration to learn from the team what went well and what needed work from each person’s perspective.

Between each Exploration, the researcher presented findings from these efforts back to the team. The project manager drafted action items based on the research findings and retro and added them to the backlog. The project manager then led a team conversation to prioritize tasks for the next sprint and Exploration.

### Team model 

Early in the project, we thought that each Exploration would be run by a different team, recruited from a rotating pool of interested parties within CDS. We learned that model wouldn't work for a number of reasons: 
- Capacity challenges meant that we didn't have a guarantee there would always be people available when we need to run an Exploration, or we ran the risk they might have competing priorities. This created a lot of instability and uncertainty, sometimes right up until the last minute before the sprint. 
- Not having continuity on the team meant a worse service for our partners - it was important to have at least a few members on the team who had done previous Explorations, because they were able to bring lessons learned forward about how the Sprints were run, as well as insights about what we're seeing in common across multiple departments

After our first pilot with Temporary Foreign Worker Program, we settled on having a single team that was both making improvements to the service, as well as delivering it. We would conduct the 4-week Exploration Sprint, and then iterate over 1 - 2 sprints before running the next Exploration. During the window of iteration, our PM would lead the team, and during the Exploration Sprint our Sprint Lead would. For more information on what the skill make-up of our team looked like, see the Stand up a dedicated Exploration sprint team section of our Sprint Guide. 

Moving forward, the Exploration Service is going to be moved within our Consulting Service, so the team model will likely continue to change.

## Learnings to date

### New enabling conditions
- Literature in dev ops and our pilot research findings surfaced the importance of an organizational culture that is open to change and adopting new practices
- In designing timelines with departments, we found that funding limitations and hiring practices can affect feasibility and slow down timelines, so they need to be taken into account early on  

### Value of Explorations

Though we don't have a lot of outcome data yet, follow-up interviews and observations revealed how the process itself is of value: 
- Participants learn from listening to one another 
- Partners using the Exploration to inform their roadmap 

We can contunue making the Explorations more efficient and design for providing this impact.

### Explorations inform Partnerships and Partnerships inform Explorations

When we conduct an Exploration, the whole team functions as researchers listening to government. Consequently, we’ve learned more about their needs which means we can share this with our Partnerships business unit. And as we design more flexible and varied partnership options, we can better set expectations during the Exploration about what's possible afterwards. 

### Varied government landscape 

We don’t have enough data yet to see trends, but we have seen two very different examples that show the contrast in deparmental conditions.
