## Why Exploration

### The problem: Partnership challenges 

One of the ways that CDS works with departments is through **Partnerships** where we work on a problem space together. But in the 3 years that CDS has existed, our Partnerships have been hard and slow.

Our delivery teams expected to roll up their sleeve and get to work from the get go, but instead ran into blockers. Constraints, such as lengthy and slow approvals, difficulty in getting access to key infrastructure, unexpected legal opinions, fuzzy problem statements and fear of launching something new, have prevented us from building with partners and sharing our work publicly. In some cases it’s even prevented us from taking the final step to go live. 

This lead to a difficult and stressful working environment for delivery teams. They were often treated like vendors rather than partners. Our partnerships had a high potential to fail. And because of that, we weren’t doing a good job delivering on our mandate to change government to serve people better.

What we want is to work with partners who are open and receptive to new ways of working: Where they provide access to the people, information and infrastructure we need. And they’re comfortable with us sharing our work, methodologies and experiences beyond the project space.  

So in May of 2020, we launched our work on our **Exploration Service**.

#### Goals of an Exploration
It's been a long journey to get here, and our goals have changed along the way, but here is where they stand now:  
- **Goal 1:** Explore the partner’s capabilities and readiness to deliver a digital service and provide practical actions to improve.
- **Goal 2:** Determine CDS’ level of involvement.
- **Goal 3:** Understand the government landscape and learn about patterns and trends.

## What is an Exploration? 

We have a couple of hypotheses: 
1. If CDS better understands the existing conditions within a service context then it will be able to better tailor its help to a department, and
2. If enabling conditions and practices are present then teams will deliver better products and services. 

An Exploration is a service we deliver to:
- Understand the existing delivery conditions and practices within a service context;
- Identify ways to introduce digital practices, like conducting user research and practicing continuous improvement;
- Make recommendations on ways to shift conditions to enable those practices, if and where needed;
- Provide advice and practical actions to develop and deliver a product or service – or improve an existing one; and
- Explore how CDS might support a partner on that journey.

### Exploring enabling conditions

To learn about a departments conditions we try to answer these two questions:

*To what extent do digital roles and structures exist?*
- Leadership and coherent direction (coherent policy direction, service priorities and champions)
- Enabling capacity and infrastructure (modern IT infrastructure, legal, comms and privacy guidance and support)
- Delivery capability (talent and teams with digital skills, tactics and tools)
 
*To what extent do digital practices exist?* 
- Shifting to a product delivery model
- Cultivating a culture of collaboration 
- Working in the open 
- Establishing and empowering multi-disciplinary teams 
- Conducting user research 
- Practicing continuous improvement

## How we developed the service

**1. Conducted background research** 
- Primary research: collecting needs from all delivery communities
- Secondary research: other frameworks (maturity models) 
- Peer feedback: ODS, GDS & C4C
- Global lens: Public Digital & Harvard Kennedy School consultations 

**2. Developed a Theory of Change**
- Informed evaluation & monitoring plan 

**3. Prototyped the framework and the service**
- Built Framework: Assessment criteria & questions 
- Developed processes & artifacts to support a service

**4. Created an org Intake model** 
- Centralized Intake: reach, readiness & replicability
- Mapped & connected CDS business units 

**5. Piloted with 4 departments, iterating between each round**
- Temporary Foreign Worker Program 
- NRCan CanmetENERGY
- NRCan Flood mapping 
- IRCC Refugee resettlement
