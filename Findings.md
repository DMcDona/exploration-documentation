# Findings: what we've learned 

As of April 2021, we've ran 4 pilot Explorations with 3 departments and 4 programs. These are the documents that we generated at the end of each Exploration with our findings and recommendations. As we improved them over time the format has changed, so there's a mix of presentations and reports.
