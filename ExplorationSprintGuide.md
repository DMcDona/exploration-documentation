##How to set up and run an Exploration 
Guide for onboarding the partner and setting up the delivery team
This guide outlines what needs to happen to set up a partner Exploration for success. It covers the series of tasks that a sprint organizer will need to ensure happens:
Before Exploration 
During Exploration 
After Exploration 
Before Exploration
Share the Exploration guide with partners
Start developing a description of the problem space
Sign the Exploration agreement
Set up weekly check-ins with the partner
Create team channels and repositories
Identify and map key stakeholders
Gather background materials
Schedule partner meetings
Stand up a dedicated Exploration sprint team 
Schedule internal sprint rituals
Share the Exploration guide with partners
The Exploration guide helps partners know what to expect from Exploration. It outlines the schedule for the month and includes questions we’ll ask stakeholders, so that the partner can start identifying who might be best suited for each of the 9 stakeholder chats. 

Ask the partner coordinator to review the questions at the end of the partner guide and work with them to identify potential stakeholders and fill out information about each person. Try to determine if this is the right person to talk to and work with them to identify the right people. Once you have a list of people, you can start mapping them in relation to other key stakeholders.

The roles are as follows: 
Functional Specialists: Executive, management, and working-level specialists responsible for providing advice and overseeing processes related to program and policy specialists are dependent on including: communications, technology, legal, access to information and privacy, etc.
Program Specialists: Executive, management, and working-level specialists responsible for the delivery of the service or program. 
Policy Specialists: Management and working-level specialists responsible for providing advice and overseeing processes related to the service including policy direction and research. 

Develop a description of the problem space
A good description of the problem space helps to put some bounds around the problem, centering on the issue rather than a proposed solution. It could include a description of the scope, the implicated users, what they’re trying to accomplish, and the impact of not addressing the problem (number of people affected, money wasted, etc.). This should be done with identified stakeholders before the start of Exploration. 
Sign the Exploration agreement
Before anything happens, a Exploration agreement should be drafted and signed by both parties. This agreement includes the CDS terms of engagement and helps keep everyone accountable. It also includes the start and end dates of Exploration as agreed by both parties.
Set up weekly check-ins with the partner
Keep communication going leading up to Exploration with weekly check-ins with the partner. Use this time to identify and map stakeholders, to refine the description of the problem space, and to answer any questions they may have.
Create team channels and repositories
To hit the ground running at the start of Exploration, establish a new Exploration sprint team Slack channel, Trello board, and document repository ahead of time. This will help facilitate communication throughout Exploration. 

Use the Google Drive document repo template and Trello sprint board template to start with all the necessary Exploration tools. Make sure that all of the files are copied to a new folder with the department acronym prepended to the title. 
Identify and map key stakeholders
Before you start, you’ll need to understand how the partner department is structured and identify the people within it who can help. You can do this with the person who is responsible for coordinating on the partner side, as well as other stakeholders in the department. 
Understanding the landscape of the partner organization is one of the primary goals of Exploration. To start, you can request high-level organizational charts from the partner. Then, have conversations to document how the different areas interrelate (for example: how the teams work together, who’s responsible for what, how they relate to the problem space). This information provides an important foundation for us to be able to identify the right people to talk to and effectively ask questions. If you have time, consider also looking up the partner department on the Government Electronic Directory Services (GEDS) to fill in some of the blanks. Make sure you validate what you find with the partner department as GEDS can sometimes be out-of-date. 
Gather background materials
Obtaining certain artifacts early on can help the team understand the problem and navigate the partner department. There are also some criteria that are evaluated based on the documentation.

These background materials should ideally include:
Departmental governance chart including relevant committees, roles and responsibilities
Program documents
Policy framework and commitments, e.g. mandate commitments, agreements, etc
Program goals and KPIs 
Program model (business model)
Program audits and evaluations
Process maps 
Logic models 
IT Roadmap 
Relevant technical or systems diagrams
Product lifecycle management documentation
Feedback and personal stories from public service users
Call centre logs and statistics
Data analytics (existing service)
Documentation surrounding governance of accessibility improvements 
Any other supporting documentation that explains who the users are, how they are impacted, and why they need help

Once they’ve been collected, make sure that they’re added to the repository of documents received from the partner in the Partner folder. If there’s additional context surrounding the purpose of the documents, consider adding information on them to the document index.
Schedule partner meetings
There are a number of core meetings that need to be scheduled in advance with partner stakeholders, including the kick-off meeting, stakeholder chats, and a final debrief. 

Use the scheduling template to document the meetings in addition to scheduling them in Google Calendar. Once the Exploration team members have been assigned to the team, make sure to also add them to the Calendar invites. 
Kick-off meeting
Week 2 will start with a 1-hour kick-off including stakeholders from the partner department and the CDS Exploration sprint team. This meeting will outline the Exploration and what’s in store over the three weeks with the partner. When you schedule the meeting with the partners, make sure to send the kick-off deck along with the invite so they have it in advance. 
Stakeholder chats 
As you identify the right people, you’ll need to schedule 1-hour stakeholder chats with them for Week 2 and add them to the schedule. Ideally stakeholder chats #1 and #2 should be scheduled as the first meetings. As you send out the invites, make sure to send the participant the partner guide with the list of questions for them.

If possible, set up all meetings with key stakeholders (such as ADMs) well in advance so that they can happen early in the first week. These are busy people you’re meeting with and you need to respect how hard it is to get on their calendars, as well as leave room for flexibility if the meeting needs to be pushed. Having someone within the department or agency who has access to calendars to help with setting these up will be critical.

You’ll also need to determine what tool the department is most comfortable with for video calling to make the discussions go as smoothly as possible. Try to find one (Microsoft Teams, Zoom etc.) that will allow face-to-face conversations (even if they choose to turn their camera off).
Final debrief
Once the team writes up their findings and a decision is made internally, CDS will present the findings back to the partner, including recommendations and next steps for the relationship. Try to book this 1-hour meeting in advance, to secure stakeholders’ calendars if possible.
Final debrief
Immediately following the final debrief with the partner, we’ll need to run a feedback session to get insights into their experience. Make sure that this happens right away so that the next iteration isn’t delayed. 
Stand up a dedicated Exploration sprint team
Create a people-matching request to build a Exploration team that includes 3-5 people with a combination of skills that together represent the required skills list below. 

Required experience
GovTech to effectively facilitate Discussions #7, and #9
Policy to effectively facilitate Discussion #4
Research
Partnerships
Design (preferably a multi-disciplinary designer with a service mindset, or content design if project is content heavy)
Product management 
Accessibility  
Government knowledge/experience (worked in government before or has been with CDS for awhile working with departments)
Empathy (in general), as well as for the government context 
Comfort facilitating discussions 
Ability to effectively give feedback to partners

Nice to have
Narrative/storytelling abilities 
Second person knowledgeable in each area who can act as backup for the skill if a team member is pulled away

Before the sprint starts, it should be clear to members of the team and their managers that Exploration is their priority. 

Schedule internal sprint rituals
There are a number of internal sprint rituals that need to be scheduled in advance: 
Team onboarding
Daily debriefs 
Heads down time 
Discussion time 
Internal playback

Use the scheduling template to document the meetings in addition to scheduling them in Google Calendar. 
Internal kick-off 
The Exploration team will have a week to onboard before the Exploration starts with the partner (Week 1). At the beginning of this week there will be a 1-hour team onboarding meeting, which is their official introduction to Exploration. Use the team onboarding deck. You’ll need to fill in information about the partner, the problem space and the service context. 
Debriefs 
After each stakeholder chat (in Week 2), the team should have an internal debrief to discuss what they heard (sensemaking), what worked and what didn’t work. In total there will likely be 2 stakeholder chats and 2 debriefs each day, so you’ll need to schedule them in advance. You may also want to schedule some debrief meetings during the onboarding week. 
Heads down time
During the stakeholder chats week (Week 2), the team should have time at least once a day to go through the notes and score the department in the scoring worksheet. They’ll also need time for making the playback deck. This requires heads down time that should be scheduled in advance. If possible, blocking off the sprint week as an “out of office” week for other non-Exploration meetings is ideal. 
Discussion time 
During the playback development weeks (Weeks 3 and 4), there will need to be time scheduled each day that the team can use to discuss the findings, recommendations and the progress on the playback deck. 
Internal playback 
In week 3, the team will need to present the findings and recommendations internally to management, to receive feedback and determine what the next steps are.

Team onboarding
The week begins on Monday with a 1-hour meeting led by the organizers to bring the team up to speed. 

Agenda:
Familiarizing everyone with the goal, how Exploration works and previous Pre-Discoveries.
Transferring knowledge gathered so far about the partner and the problem space. 
Getting to know each other and understanding roles, skill sets, and experience.
Setting expectations for work schedule, methodology, and projected deliverables.
Knowing how to communicate with team members and team commitments.

Review past Exploration sprints
The team should read the playback deck, as well as stakeholder chats and debrief notes from previous sprints to get a sense for how they go and what to expect.

The team can also consult advice and lessons learned from previous teams in Appendix A.
Read partner documentation
The team should read through the relevant documentation given by the partner. This will help them understand the problem space. 
Score partner documentation
As the team reads through the documentation, they should be scoring the relevant criteria in the “Documentation review” section of the scoring worksheet. 
Read facilitation guides
The team should read through the facilitation guides and identify which stakeholder chats they’re most comfortable facilitating. 


Assign roles 
Each stakeholder chat needs to have:
1 facilitator
1 notetaker
1 backup facilitator 
1 backup notetaker

Prepare for kick-off and stakeholder chats 
Familiarize yourself with the partner’s description of the problem space, the stakeholder map, the next week’s schedule, the stakeholder chat discussion questions, and scoring criteria.
Debriefs 
It might be helpful to have some informal debrief sessions during the week for the team to discuss what they’re reading and ask any questions about the process.

Partner kick-off
The week begins on Monday with a 1-hour kick-off meeting with the partner stakeholders, the Exploration team and the sprint organizers.

Agenda:
Introduction to Exploration
Brief intro on the problem space
Introduction to partner stakeholders who will participate in Exploration
Deep dive into how Exploration works i.e. work plan, methodology for stakeholder chat discussions and decision making as team, outputs 

If someone isn’t able to make it, make sure you make note of it and send them the material (if they don’t  have it already). 
Stakeholder chats
Throughout the week the team is responsible for running the 9 stakeholder chats. There is one facilitator and one note taker for each stakeholder chat. The notes taken should be verbatim notes to ensure there’s raw data to refer to. They’ll take notes directly in the facilitation guide (make sure there’s a labelled copy for each stakeholder chat).

While only two of the team members are running the meeting with stakeholders (facilitating and note taking), everyone should be at the meeting listening to the answers. 
Debriefs 
After each stakeholder chat, the team should have a debrief session, led by the sprint organizer. This will function as an informal sense-making session to go over what they heard, what’s missing, what went well and what could be improved. Each debrief should have an assigned note taker.
Scoring
After each stakeholder chat, the team members should individually score the stakeholder chat while it’s still fresh in their mind. This will be done during heads down time. 

Each team member will score for each criteria with supporting rationale/evidence as to why they chose that score.

If a team member isn’t able to make an stakeholder chat, and doesn’t feel comfortable scoring based on the notes provided, they should leave their score blank and make a note that they didn’t attend the meeting in the rationale column.

Analyze findings
During heads down time, the team should review the evidence they listed in the scoring worksheets and asynchronously fill out the analysis template.
Review findings
Then, in a discussion facilitated by the Sprint Organizer and the Head of Business Development, the team should review the findings documented. They should also look at the scoring and discuss any areas where there is a large divergence. Then they should come to a consensus on what they recommend as next steps for the partnership. For this process, the Head of Business Development should provide a viable set of options that the team can discuss and vote on. 
Create final playback
Together the team should outline the final playback deck and then they can work on it asynchronously to fill it in. 
Present playback internally 
The team should present the deck internally to management, to get feedback on the recommendations and to come to a final decision on next steps for the partnership.

Iterate playback
Once the team receives feedback from management, they should iterate on the deck to incorporate it and finalize the next steps.
Facilitated discussion

Present playback to partner
The team and the Head of Business Development present the revised deck and finalized next steps to the partner stakeholders. The deck should be sent at least a day ahead of time to allow them time to review it. 
Sprint team retro
The sprint organizer should run an internal retro with the team to get feedback on how the Exploration process went. This information should be translated into the backlog of the Exploration Framework team’s Trello board for future iteration.
After Exploration
Get feedback from partner
Document lessons learned
Get feedback from partner
The sprint organizer should run a feedback session with the partner, either in a group setting or multiple 1:1s, depending what they’re comfortable with. You should use the feedback template and add any additional questions that you feel are necessary. 
Document lessons learned
Add insights and advice from the team’s retro and from partner feedback to Appendix A and the Onboarding Deck for future sprint teams. This could include any tips, recommendations for success and pitfalls that they encountered.
Appendix A: Advice from previous sprints 
This appendix contains learnings from previous CDS Exploration sprints, as well as learnings from the USDS sprints. At the end of each sprint it should be added to (in suggestion mode), by the sprint organizer and/or the team.  
Mindset 
The way we show up during our client interactions reflects upon our brand. In that light, let’s remember to:
Be humble
Adopt a service mindset
Give praise to agency partners (And teammates!)
Remember: we’re solving for humans, not systems
Aggressively discover as much information as quickly as possible. Agencies may not want to overwhelm us, but we need all the data and info we can get our hands on.
Tips for success 
Understand sprint logistics, the agency and have a sense of the lay of the land before arriving
Understand deliverables
Ensure team has access to all people, documents, information, and artifacts
Ensure that clear roles, responsibilities, and tasks are defined for each team member
Ask your high‐level champions in the department to communicate their support down the chain of command
Excellent structure for the sprint
Start with a problem description and refer back to it often
Be prepared to listen
Ask for organizational chart and do stakeholder mapping before the sprint
Have a Google Drive repository where the team can upload docs and relevant information.
Past pitfalls (CDS)
Not having backups for roles, which left the team hurting when people became sick, were late or had their attention divided.
Not all participants were dedicated full‐time to the sprint.
Difficulty figuring out how to package the feedback for the department
Not enough onboarding time to the problem space and documentation to orient the team
Skipping over the background questions when facilitating a stakeholder chat - there wasn’t enough of an opening icebreaker to ensure the partner felt comfortable to be open and honest
Past pitfalls (USDS)
USDS has run similar sprints, with a different purpose, but similar format. The following are learnings they documented from their experience: 
Deferring meetings, which may not be possible to schedule in the future. Meet early and follow‐up as needed. Seize moments for meetings.
Colleagues didn't understand each other’s strengths (design, engineering, product, etc) to best allocate resources.
New USDS team members thrown onto a sprint, with no background on what a sprint is, what the expectations are, etc.
Not understanding how to package feedback from the agencies.
Not enough time for the team to get to know each other, preparation, and follow‐up after sprint.
Weak communication across Sprint Team and agency. Two weeks is a condensed time to learn everything about an agency. It is critical to build a strong communication foundation.
No scoping or expectation‐setting in advance: Management consulting project and personnel sensitivities.
People selected were not all ideal; one weak link, a person told they were lead who wasn’t capable of running the project, major interpersonal team issues around gender.
Extremely intensive stakeholder engagement and influencer engagement that added a lot of complexity to the process.
Team size too large. With N > 6, the probability of losing at least one person to a "really important" meeting approaches 1 and the pressure to delay or reschedule things kills momentum.
Poor adherence to working hours means stand‐ups don't work.

Advice for future sprints
Have the Sprint Team spend time together before the sprint!
Start with a welcome packet “How to do a sprint” for each team (the onboarding deck).
Point out resources available to Sprinters. 
Read through previous sprint team notes. 
Block off the weeks of the sprint as out‐of‐office for non‐sprint meetings. If everyone continues to attend meetings, that means there’s little time that the entire team is in one place and sprinting together, which hurts the sprint more than you might think.
Set a tone of respect for the people at the target agency. In the Discovery sprint, we are walking into a situation where we are implicitly judging people...and regardless of how competent or incompetent they might have been at their job, they probably still have been trying and caring. Coming in on a high horse is extremely dangerous. Not acknowledging and respecting the historical effort + good intentions is just mean.
You are going to be in a high‐pressure situation. Start coordinating with your team members over Slack early now to form the team. Get a feel for who’s the “lead” type, who's the “support” type and if there are any problematic characters (people with egos, people who need lots of special attention, etc). Pushing the team from forming ‐> storming ‐> norming on day 1 is critical.
Make sure you have a debrief each day. 
Ensure you have multiple forms of connectivity in case you run into tech issues. 
Talk to the people/engs/contractors, not the leads. Do it as much as possible. You will get more honesty.
Talk to the leads too, but you will do that naturally so no need to place extra emphasis on it.
Build a 5‐second elevator pitch about who you are and why your opinion matters – don’t be a jerk, but also throw humility out the window. There’s not enough time for modesty. People want to know why they are talking to you so being clear is helpful.
Albert from USDS’s example: “I’ve been an engineer at Google for 9 years currently working on Chrome. I’ve managed teams in security, remote desktop, and am the team go‐to for continuous build, git, and productivity..."
Provide training and government orientation to those brand new to government (but preferably get folks who have government experience/knowledge).
Do a little skill‐building/light training of each others’ skill sets in advance so that you're generally familiar with the team's collective expertise.
When you’re giving feedback or writing the deck, ask yourself, “Will this help the team?” Beware of things that may come across as kicks in the face, or bringing up things that aren’t news to them.
If it’s sensitive, have a conversation in person.
Note the exceptional people you meet along the way, and mention them, where appropriate, to higher ups as folks who helped the sprint succeed.
Everyone is a designer. Give people permission and an opportunity to get their ideas heard when you meet with them.
Depending on the scope of your project, it may be appropriate for you to request letters people have written to the Minister for the topic you’re covering.
Resist making the sprint team larger than 3‐5 people. 
Post COVID 
If travel is likely, make sure team members are set up for that, and factor in time for approvals.
Bring your own AV connectivity: cables appropriate for your laptop to connect to projectors and a remote control to advance slides
Ensure you have multiple forms of connectivity. At USCIS and DOD, we were highly hampered by the building killing all cellular signals, or not having cells at all, and not having IM. If you scatter off to do individual research, have a fallback plan on how to regroup midday if all cell phones don’t work.
