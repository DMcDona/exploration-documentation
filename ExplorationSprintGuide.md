### 1. Share the partner guide with partners

The [Partner Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXYu0HcB_wkvn98RqPWeEvJiB1wRC_dhdTxdHXw21Xw/edit#heading=h.wb82wfeldvp6) helps partners know what to expect from Exploration. It outlines the schedule for the month and includes topics we’ll explore with stakeholders, so the partner can start identifying who might be best suited for each of the stakeholder chats. 

Ask the partner coordinator to [review the potential questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXYu0HcB_wkvn98RqPWeEvJiB1wRC_dhdTxdHXw21Xw/edit#bookmark=id.jwibarwde9ee) at the end of the Partner Guide, and work with them to identify potential stakeholders and fill out information about each person. Add this information to the “Participant Biographies” tab of the [Scheduling spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19z-6nAyBwawU0_-_QdEF4XP83MY4YYnO679bQ_KLFuY/edit#gid=2072067210).This documentation about potential stakeholders will help the Explorations team refine the interview guides for each person and their role. Once you have a list of people, you can start 

<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "mapping them in relation to other key stakeholders"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[mapping them in relation to other key stakeholders](#heading=h.iu6ftwbp9lrp).

Stakeholders are sorted into three different types of role, for the purpose of interviewing. The interview roles are: 



    1. **Functional Specialists**: Executive, management, and working-level stakeholders responsible for providing advice and overseeing processes related to program and policy specialists. This role includes communications, technology, legal, access to information and privacy, etc.
    2. **Program Specialists**: Executive, management, and working-level specialists responsible for the delivery of the service or program. 
    3. **Policy Specialists**: Management and working-level specialists responsible for providing advice and overseeing processes related to the service including policy direction and research.


### 2. Get the Exploration agreement signed

Before anything else happens, an [Exploration agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_TPBv8mvu6DMWpdJQs5Je3pv4tAFT-toHR1LAhtqL-Q/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs) should be drafted and signed by CDS and the Director/DG from the partner team. This agreement includes the CDS terms of engagement and helps keep everyone accountable. It also includes the start and end dates of Exploration as agreed by both parties.


### 3. Develop a description of the problem space

An effective [description of the problem space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIf3QUmVLml1HNqyTkn3j5F2pIWcaAkDvVKPBCbrcEw/edit#heading=h.gkzk4s2j2o2w) helps to put some bounds around the problem, centering on the issue rather than a proposed solution. It could include a description of the scope, the implicated users, what they’re trying to accomplish, and the impact of not addressing the problem (number of people affected, money wasted, etc.). This should be done with identified stakeholders before the start of Exploration. This description is very valuable for the Exploration sprint team coming onboard and is often included in the playback information.


### 4. Set up weekly check-ins with the partner

Start by establishing the method of communication, many departments aren’t able to use Google hangouts easily. 

Keep communication going leading up to the Exploration with weekly check-ins with the partner. Use this time to identify and map stakeholders, refine the description of the problem space, and answer any questions they may have. During this time they’ll be briefing people within the department and getting buy-in, which means they’ll be explaining what CDS is, what we do and what people should expect. Support them by providing them with useful and accurate information.


### 5. Create team channels and repositories

To hit the ground running at the start of Exploration, establish a new Exploration sprint team Slack channel, Trello board, and document repository ahead of time. This will help facilitate communication throughout Exploration. 

Use the format #exploration-department-project for the Slack channel name. Also use the [Google Drive document repo template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YKLv_xjPT89yFz9nqSb0XAGJFkLQAhL3) and [Trello sprint board template](https://trello.com/b/jSavdn0U/pre-discovery-sprint-management) to start with all the necessary Exploration tools. Make sure that all of the template files are copied to a new folder in the [Partner Sprints folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oCHpDiBGeuGZjo21qL2l5owQsovGO-A0) with the department acronym prepended to the title. 


### 6. Identify and map key stakeholders

Before you start, you’ll need to understand how the partner department is structured and identify the people within it who can help. To do this, run a [Stakeholder Mapping workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l1nnP89_FGYKcVCp1-9fKt8kEDvYffl2hTdVV5q2Xzg/edit) with the person who is responsible for coordinating on the partner side, as well as other stakeholders in the department (if necessary). Ideally, you should include executives and managers to this session as they often have a broader view of the organization.

Understanding the landscape of the partner organization is one of the primary goals of Exploration. To start, you can request high-level organizational charts from the partner. Then, have conversations to document how the different areas interrelate (for example: how the teams work together, who’s responsible for what, how they relate to the problem space). This information provides an important foundation for us to be able to identify the right people to talk to and effectively ask questions. If you have time, consider also looking up the partner department on the [Government Electronic Directory Services (GEDS)](https://geds-sage.gc.ca/en/GEDS?pgid=002) to fill in some of the blanks. Make sure you validate what you find with the partner department as GEDS can sometimes be out-of-date. 


### 7. Gather background material

Obtaining certain artifacts and documents early in the process can help the team understand the problem and navigate the partner department’s culture. 

These background materials should include:



*   Departmental governance chart including relevant committees, roles, and responsibilities
*   Program documents
    *   Policy framework and commitments, e.g. mandate commitments, agreements, etc
    *   Program goals and KPIs 
    *   Program model (business model)
    *   Program audits and evaluations
    *   Process maps 
    *   Logic models 
    *   IT Roadmap 
*   Relevant technical or systems diagrams
*   Product lifecycle management documentation
*   Documentation surrounding governance of accessibility improvements 
*   Documentation around IT Asset Management or Change Advisory Board process (ideally recent minutes from meetings where they discussed new technologies)
*   Any other supporting documentation that explains who the users are, how they are impacted, and why they need help

Once they’ve been collected, make sure that they’re added to the [repository of documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nWf_uHzCkkCehJtJwoNjvXY5pOSs0dwJ) received from the partner in the Partner folder. If there’s additional context surrounding the purpose of the documents, consider adding information on them in a document index.


### 8. Create a glossary for the sprint

Partner departments often use acronyms and terms the team may not be immediately familiar with. Add terms to the [glossary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yywp0IK9zy3JuGsqCmUW0jQ2AmSN3WSPgnUF--Aio_4/edit) to keep track of new language throughout the preparation and the sprint itself.


### 9. Schedule partner meetings

There are a number of core meetings that need to be scheduled in advance with partner stakeholders, including the kick-off meeting and stakeholder chats. 

Use the [scheduling template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19z-6nAyBwawU0_-_QdEF4XP83MY4YYnO679bQ_KLFuY/edit) to document the meetings in addition to scheduling them in Google Calendar. Once the Exploration team members have been assigned to the team, make sure to also add them to the Calendar invites. 


#### 9.1 Kick-off meeting

Week 2 will start with a 1-hour kick-off including stakeholders from the partner department and the CDS Exploration sprint team. This meeting will outline the Exploration and what’s in store over the three weeks with the partner. When you schedule the meeting with the partners, make sure to send the kick-off deck along with the invite so they have it in advance. You should also get a sense of who will attend the kick-off, to make sure you’re appropriately addressing the audience. Sometimes people who aren’t being interviewed come because they’re interested.


#### 9.2 Schedule stakeholder chats 

As you identify the right people, you’ll need to schedule 1-hour stakeholder chats with them for Week 2 and add them to [the schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19z-6nAyBwawU0_-_QdEF4XP83MY4YYnO679bQ_KLFuY/edit). Ideally stakeholder chats #1 and #2 should be scheduled as the first meetings. As you send out the invites, make sure to send the participant the list of questions for them (in both official languages). It’s recommended that you include that we may deviate from the questions as the conversation flows. The questions included in the invite are only to guide the conversation.


```
Example meeting request:

We're looking forward to talking to you about <<the service>>. We will update this meeting invite with the questions we intend to explore on the Friday prior to this session. If you have any questions in the meantime please don't hesitate to reach out to myself or <<main stakeholder>>.

```


If possible, set up all meetings with key stakeholders (such as ADMs) well in advance so that they can happen early in the first week. They’re busy people and it’s hard to get on their calendars. You also want to leave room for flexibility if the meeting needs to be pushed. Having someone within the department or agency who has access to calendars to help with setting these up will be critical.

You’ll also need to determine what tool the department is most comfortable with for video calling to make the discussions go as smoothly as possible. Try to find one (Microsoft Teams, Zoom etc.) that will allow face-to-face conversations (even if they choose to turn their camera off).


### 10. Stand up a dedicated Exploration sprint team _(if applicable)_

Create a [people-matching request](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11N5_1hGnBGoh8fJCYtgw4I5hNNUSNPIwzOPDIBjHJtI/edit#) to build an Exploration team that includes 3-5 people with a combination of skills that together represent the required skills list below. 

**Required experience**



*   GovTech to effectively facilitate Discussions #7, and #9
*   Policy to effectively facilitate Discussion #4
*   Research
*   Partnerships
*   Design (preferably a multi-disciplinary designer with a service mindset, or content design if project is content heavy)
*   Product management 
*   Accessibility  
*   Government knowledge/experience (worked in government before or has been with CDS for awhile working with departments)
*   Empathy (in general), as well as for the government context 
*   Comfort facilitating discussions 
*   Ability to effectively give feedback to partners

**Nice to have**



*   Narrative/storytelling abilities 
*   Second person knowledgeable in each area who can act as backup for the skill if a team member is pulled away

Before the sprint starts, it should be clear to members of the team and their managers that Exploration is their priority. 


### 11. Schedule internal sprint rituals

Sprint rituals that need to be scheduled and socialized in advance include:



*   Team onboarding
*   Daily debrief 
*   Heads down time 
*   Discussion time 
*   Playback internal discussion

Use the [scheduling template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19z-6nAyBwawU0_-_QdEF4XP83MY4YYnO679bQ_KLFuY/edit#gid=0) to document the meetings in addition to scheduling them in Google Calendar. 


#### 11.1 Internal kick-off 

The Exploration team will have a week to onboard before the Exploration starts with the partner (Week 1). At the beginning of this week there will be a 1-hour team onboarding meeting, which is their official introduction to Exploration. Use the [team onboarding deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/178a_IBodqR-5SFxYMwu0EWJMILRW2JE2MJBvn_K1ClU/edit#slide=id.g4cea57f733_0_0). Before the meeting you’ll need to fill in information about the partner, the problem space and the service context. 


#### 11.2 Debriefs 

At the end of each day (in Week 2), the team should have an internal debrief to discuss what they heard (sensemaking), what worked and what didn’t work. Follow the [Debrief Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dd3hcdHYBn7VNo_2vP0yFXUk_UPe9viFpahBGiznS54/edit) guide. In total there will likely be 2 stakeholder chats each day, so you’ll need to schedule them in advance. You may also want to schedule some debrief meetings during the onboarding week as folks are exploring documentation. 


#### 11.3 Heads down time

During the stakeholder chats week (Week 2), the team should have time at least once a day to go through the notes and score the department in the [scoring worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HswndK3RXIvu3MAK6kI0kGYoPgsYSJvnBpLNPQRjHMc/edit). They’ll also need time for making the playback documentation (Week 3). This requires heads down time that should be scheduled in advance. If possible, blocking off the sprint week as an “out of office” week for other non-Exploration meetings is ideal. 


#### 11.4 Discussion time 

During the playback development weeks (Weeks 3 and 4), there will need to be time scheduled each day that the team can use to discuss the findings, recommendations and the progress on the playback deck. 


#### 11. 5 Playback internal discussion 

In week 3, the team will need to discuss the findings and recommendations internally with:



*   Head of Business Development
    *   Typically they are invited to Recommendation Review sessions mid-week after insights have been synthesized and recommendations have been identified
*   Director of Partnerships
    *   This can take place as a meeting or sharing the report and following up - best to discuss to identify how they would like to receive the information and provide feedback
*   CEO
    *   Share the report for feedback
    *   This will likely take place in week 4 once the report is closer to completion

##### Throughout Exploration



*   Check in with team members weekly if they have vacation, days off planned or other priorities.
*   Ensure all meetings have a notetaker identified.
*   Post notes from any meetings with the partner sponsor in case team members would like to review.
*   Use Trello and walk the board during stand up to review what each card means, go over blockers, what people did yesterday and what they plan on doing today.
*   Post to Slack channel key next steps out of any team sessions. Use CDS communication techniques asking for emoticon reactions to acknowledge.

> Examples:

> Some may have noticed I've been adding things to trello. My life mantra is  "if it's not written down it doesn't exist". Feel free to add your own cards for things you are working on or comment / modify cards I've made.
I also put a "weird parking lot" at the far right which is where I put all the things that don't really have a home. Right now it's the potential future action for the "framework team" to maybe look at how we ask for documentation and iterate on that piece.
Please give me an 🐘 if you can access trello and feel comfortable using it. Or give me a DM if you want me to walk through it I'm happy to do that.

> Recap of my thoughts for early next week:
Monday daytime - finish scoring / rationale (if you haven't already)
Monday time together - talk about things we want - divvy up interviews for people to pull details from - maybe walk through miro we'll use to organize
Monday afternoon / Tuesday morning - fill miro with things
Tuesday afternoon together - review miro and talk about report format / goals / recommendations
My goal is to provide opportunities to work asynchronously as well as collaborate together on our insights and recommendations.
Please give me a 👍 👎  on this or a 🤷‍♀️ or a comment in 🧵 or really any sort of reaction.  🍷 ?

#### Team onboarding

The week begins on Monday with a 1-hour meeting led by the organizers to bring the team up to speed.  \
 \
**Agenda:**



*   Familiarizing everyone with the goal, how Exploration works and previous Pre-Discoveries.
*   Transferring knowledge gathered so far about the partner and the problem space. 
*   Getting to know each other and understanding roles, skill sets, and experience.
*   Setting expectations for work schedule, methodology, and projected deliverables.
*   Knowing how to communicate with team members and team commitments.


#### Review past Exploration sprints

Any new team members should read the playback report, as well as [stakeholder chats and debrief notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oCHpDiBGeuGZjo21qL2l5owQsovGO-A0) from previous sprints to get a sense for how they go and what to expect.

The team can also consult advice and lessons learned from previous teams in [Appendix A](#bookmark=id.ljytxnci4wbd).


#### Read partner documentation

The team should read through the [relevant documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nWf_uHzCkkCehJtJwoNjvXY5pOSs0dwJ) given by the partner. This will help them understand the problem space. 


#### Prepare for kick-off and stakeholder chats 

Familiarize yourself with the partner’s [description of the problem space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIf3QUmVLml1HNqyTkn3j5F2pIWcaAkDvVKPBCbrcEw/edit), the stakeholder map, the [next week’s schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19z-6nAyBwawU0_-_QdEF4XP83MY4YYnO679bQ_KLFuY/edit), the [stakeholder chat discussion questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13RvzPfXaGsqmzQerChKIXte1lktj2NOm_c0z2eKD3vE/edit#gid=0), and [scoring criteria](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HswndK3RXIvu3MAK6kI0kGYoPgsYSJvnBpLNPQRjHMc/edit#gid=1968493336).

Once we know who we will be interviewing and when, populate [the interview guides ](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/19Kvos1BZYydPXFPQ1YUhVjb991bkuc4HRE1LuuaAxgQ/edit)with the [appropriate questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13RvzPfXaGsqmzQerChKIXte1lktj2NOm_c0z2eKD3vE/edit#gid=0) and update the placeholder meeting invites with the questions.


```
Example meeting request:

We're looking forward to talking to you about <<the service>>. I've included the questions we plan on asking below. I say "plan" because often in these conversations we start with the written questions and then follow the flow of conversation. Don't be alarmed if we skip questions or hop around the list below when we talk to you.

<<questions in English & French>>
```



#### Review interview questions and build facilitation guides

The team should read through the [interview questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/13RvzPfXaGsqmzQerChKIXte1lktj2NOm_c0z2eKD3vE/edit) to see if any changes need to be made. Then build the facilitation guides from the [boilerplate templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FiA8laI_XU8FnSfW5LyuyoX9qTaaB3mH1EY5Nja0uA/) and identify which stakeholder chats they’re most comfortable facilitating. 


#### Workshop on interviewing and note taking

For those new to CDS’s way of conducting research interviews and note taking the Research Community [has put together a training session on these topics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f7HmhwJ338sAoc-cI87rOh6NU5SVCJdZz7whnGh5VGI/edit#slide=id.g470bce74c5_0_0). Everyone is encouraged to take it as a refresher prior to the interview week of the exploration.


#### Assign roles 

Each stakeholder chat needs to have:



*   1 facilitator
*   1 notetaker
*   1 backup facilitator / note taker

These are documented in the [scheduling sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19z-6nAyBwawU0_-_QdEF4XP83MY4YYnO679bQ_KLFuY/edit)


#### Debriefs 

It might be helpful to have some informal debrief sessions during the week for the team to discuss what they’re reading and ask any questions about the process. 


```
Example agendas:

For our sessions this week I think Wednesday / Thursday agenda:
10:00-10:05 - talk about some weird topic
10:05-10:25 - round table 3 minutes each talking about top insight(s) and question(s) from document review (A-Z by first name)
I made a funretro board mainly for the voting / consolidation of similar items functionality. If people have strong feelings I'm happy to switch to a different medium.
10:25-10:30 - grouping / voting on ones we want to discuss more
10:30-10:50 - discussing those things

For Friday:
10:00-10:05 - weird topic yet again (sorry it's what happens in meetings with me)
10:05-10:15 - review schedule / facilitator / note taker assignments
10:15-10:40 - review interview guides and any questions -- making sure our outstanding questions from Wednesday / Thursday can be answered by our interview guides
10:40-10:50 - any final prep for the kick-off meeting
```

#### Partner kick-off

The week begins on Monday with a 1-hour kick-off meeting with the partner stakeholders, the Exploration team and the sprint organizers.

**Agenda:**



*   Introduction to Exploration
*   Brief intro on the problem space
*   Introduction to partner stakeholders who will participate in Exploration
*   Overview of CDS and how Exploration works 

If a department participant isn’t able to make it, make sure you make note of it and send them the material (if they don’t have it already). 


#### Stakeholder chats

Throughout the week the team is responsible for running the **[stakeholder chats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13RvzPfXaGsqmzQerChKIXte1lktj2NOm_c0z2eKD3vE/edit)**. There is one facilitator and one note taker for each stakeholder chat. The notes taken should be verbatim as much as possible, to ensure there’s raw data to refer back to. They’ll take notes directly in the facilitation guide under each question (make sure there’s a labelled copy for each stakeholder chat). We recommend putting the notes in another colour such as blue.

Although only two of the team members are running the meeting with stakeholders (facilitating and note taking), everyone should be at the debrief to hear what was said. 

Set up a thread in Slack for backchannel conversations during the interview. Interviewers may or may not be able to review this backchannel during the interview so if there is a question that should be asked of the stakeholder, team members should use meeting techniques to raise it to the stakeholder.


#### Debriefs 

At the end of each day (in Week 2), the team should have an internal debrief to discuss what they heard (sensemaking), what worked and what didn’t work. Each debrief should have an assigned note taker.

It is recommended you take notes of the debrief into the airtable to remove the need to port over insights during week 3 synthesis.


```
Option A* (Workshop debrief if only part of the team participating in interview):
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dd3hcdHYBn7VNo_2vP0yFXUk_UPe9viFpahBGiznS54/edit?usp=sharing
*This is the preferred option, as having less people in the interview is better for the interviewee.

Option B (full team participation in interview - suggested agenda):
First 5 minutes - settle in / buffer time
Next 10 minutes - framework feedback (documented by framework researcher)
Next 15 minutes - first interview insights (documented into insights table)
Next 15 minutes - second interview insights (documented into insights table)
Final 5 minutes - go over what's next 
```



#### Introduction to Scoring

For those new to Exploration, holding a “30 minute introduction to scoring” session on Tuesday is helpful for them to familiarize themselves with the scoring sheet and process. Doing it in Week 2 rather than Week 1 limits the information overload and provides the overview just in time.


#### Scoring

After each stakeholder chat, the team members should individually [score](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HswndK3RXIvu3MAK6kI0kGYoPgsYSJvnBpLNPQRjHMc/edit#gid=1968493336) the stakeholder chat while it’s still fresh in their mind. This will be done during heads down time. 

Each team member will score for each criteria with supporting rationale/evidence as to why they chose that score. We use these scores to have a quantitative value to each group that takes part in an exploration. We also use the values to start discussions among the team during debriefs.

If a team member isn’t able to make a stakeholder chat, and doesn’t feel comfortable scoring based on the notes provided, they should delete their score (so it doesn’t show up in the aggregate) and make a note that they didn’t attend the meeting in the rationale column.

#### Analyze findings and create recommendations

The analysis will be completed in** three phases**. In this phase, the Sprint Organizer and team should choose 2 - 3 people to be the core team for the analysis and who will then help to write the report. Ideally, a researcher is one member of the core analysis team. 


##### **Phase 1: Discuss scores and review findings cumulatively**



1. **Score discussion. **The team will meet to go through the score sheet. Before meeting, highlight any areas of divergent scoring. These will be reviewed and reconciled, when appropriate. This discussion will inform subsequent analysis.


##### **Phase 2: Data input and group analysis **



1. **Heads down data input: **The Sprint Organizer will ask each team member to review a selection of the interviews and put the findings from them into the analysis template. Document team member assignments in the [scheduling sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19z-6nAyBwawU0_-_QdEF4XP83MY4YYnO679bQ_KLFuY/edit). During heads down time, each team member will review the notes from their assigned interview(s) as well as insights from the debrief and scoring guide on those topics. They will identify relevant findings (highlight) then add each of these identified findings to [the analysis airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invquuHIjL1BoxwUW&inviteToken=b35d24b4530f8f9c997f96d5290be718962ffe86192640c0232824cbf3b7973f) spreadsheet. Each finding, whether interview excerpt or other observation, should make up only one row of the spreadsheet. 
2. **Group analysis: **In a group session, team members will then categorize each excerpt into predefined categories based on the enabling conditions and product phases. 


##### **Phase 3: Category refinement and recommendation generation **



1. **Category refinement: **A core team of people (2 - 3 people including the researcher) will refine the categories. The core team will share these with the full team for feedback. These categories will serve as organizing themes in the report.
2. **Recommendation generation: **Based on these refined categories, the core team will generate recommendations for each category of findings. These will be shared with the rest of the team to generate a complete list of recommendations. These recommendations will be used in the roadmap exercise. 


#### Create playback document

Assign a playback lead to own the writing (or delegation of writing). Ideally there is a small-ish team working to write the final playback documentation based on the collaborative analysis and informed by the scoring.  \


Identify a reasonable draft completion date so the partner and internal CDS leadership can be kept up to date on when their inputs will be needed.


#### Share playback internally 

The team should share the draft report internally to management (Head of Partnerships and Head of Business Development), to get feedback on the insights and recommendations. 


#### Share draft playback with partner

We have found if we send the playback to the core partner stakeholder (plus one or two others) when it is still in the draft stage it increases engagement and collaboration. The draft should have well articulated insights (“what we heard”) and recommendations. The executive summary, timeline / next steps and conclusion are typically left blank in this version of the document.


#### Schedule recommendation workshop

A few days after the draft report is delivered we will hold a [recommendation review and roadmap workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QW8De-E1JAAtGUg3EBLWh6FjmCPBgjkJWdiqJE4z-ZM/edit). Try to book this 1-hour meeting in advance (during Week 3), to secure stakeholders’ calendars if possible.


### Week 4: Iterate and collaborate externally (part-time)

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



#### Run recommendation workshop

A few days after the draft report has been sent to the partner we meet to discuss the recommendations and to start to map them into a more helpful format than a long list. For details on this workshop please see [this document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QW8De-E1JAAtGUg3EBLWh6FjmCPBgjkJWdiqJE4z-ZM/edit)


#### Iterate playback

Once the team receives feedback from management and the partner, they should iterate on the report to incorporate it and finalize the next steps.


#### Prepare and send report

Once finalized, the report should be sent to Outreach for translation and design. The completed report should then be sent to the partner department and OCEO.


#### Sprint team retro

The sprint organizer should run an [internal retro](https://funretro.io/publicboard/jcO82uiyj6QIIJ0hUtetJM39un22/a9bcb36d-be4c-4c65-bf71-48691528ef96?sort=votes) with the team to get feedback on how the Exploration process went. This information should be translated into the backlog of the [Exploration Framework team’s Trello board](https://trello.com/b/zOibssWn/pre-discovery-framework-development) for future iteration.


## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">After Exploration</span>



*   [Get feedback from partner](#bookmark=id.ohparoupi1a6)
*   [Document lessons learned](#bookmark=id.wr8qn9h78gu)
*   [Add tasks to Trello Inbox ](#bookmark=id.bxmktk1mk0ua)


### Get feedback from partner

The Sprint Organizer should run a feedback session with the partner, either in a group setting or multiple 1:1s, depending what they’re comfortable with. You should use the [feedback template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18H3NIq2HchzcAW4FkwJTYZipfmBlwAbuGcCvGp-wYs0/edit) and add any additional questions that you feel are necessary. 


### Document lessons learned

Add insights and advice from the team’s retro and from partner feedback to [Appendix A](#bookmark=id.ljytxnci4wbd) and the [Onboarding Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/178a_IBodqR-5SFxYMwu0EWJMILRW2JE2MJBvn_K1ClU/edit#slide=id.ga64436b04b_0_0) for future sprint teams. This could include any tips and recommendations for success, or pitfalls that they encountered.


### Add tasks to Trello Inbox

Once you have the research and retro insights, add cards to the “Inbox” column in the [Exploration Framework Development Trello](https://trello.com/b/zOibssWn/exploration-framework-development) with the task as the title and the finding as the background information. This will be the foundation for the next/future iterating and will be prioritized by the team to be added to the backlog.


## 


## Appendix A: Advice from previous sprints 

This appendix contains learnings from previous CDS Exploration sprints, as well as learnings from the USDS sprints. At the end of each sprint it should be added to (in suggestion mode), by the sprint organizer and/or the team.  


### Mindset 

The way we show up during our client interactions reflects upon our brand. In that light, let’s remember to:



*   Be humble
*   Adopt a service mindset
*   Be collaborative wherever possible
*   Meet departments where they are
*   Give praise to department partners (and teammates!)
*   Remember: we’re solving for humans, not systems


### Tips for success 



*   Understand sprint logistics, the agency and have a sense of the lay of the land before arriving
*   Understand deliverables (scoring, report etc.)
*   Ensure team has access to all people, documents, information, and artifacts
*   Ensure that clear roles, responsibilities, and tasks are defined for each team member
*   Ask your high‐level champions in the department to communicate their support down the chain of command
*   Excellent structure for the sprint - one designated Sprint Lead to make sure everything gets done and runs smoothly
*   Be prepared to listen
*   Ask for an organizational chart and do stakeholder mapping before the sprint.
*   Make sure any new team members have enough context and know what’s expected of them, so they’re not just thrown into it.
*   Build strong communication across the Sprint Team and the department - it’s a very short window of time, a strong foundation of communication is vital. 
*   Help all team members feel comfortable facilitating interviews regardless of their skillset. 
*   Speak their language. We’re trying to understand where they’re at currently, be careful of using too much jargon, or if you do, make sure you explain it.  


### Past pitfalls 



*   Not having backups for roles, which left the team hurting when people became sick, were late or had their attention divided.
*   Not all participants were dedicated full‐time to the sprint.
*   Difficulty figuring out how to package the feedback for the department 
*   Not having enough onboarding time to get familiar with the problem space and documentation to orient the team
*   Skipping over the background questions when facilitating a stakeholder chat - there wasn’t enough of an opening icebreaker to ensure the partner felt comfortable to be open and honest
*   People not reading the sprint guide (this document) and missing important or helpful tasks
*   Not explaining why the whole team (5 people) showed up to the interviews led to the participant feeling uneasy.
*   Last minute time off / vacations killed momentum
*   Having too many cooks in the kitchen when writing the playback at the end - try doing a core team or at least have one designated lead responsible for delegating and overseeing 
*   Not working collaboratively with the partner and just lobbing findings and recommendations over the fence to them means we’re not sure if they’re landing - better to bring them into the process 
*   Timelines were extended because packaging the feedback was difficult and it took longer than expected
*   Not setting expectations effectively - the partner expecting more from us than we can provide post-sprint. 
*   Not tracking things that were happening during the sprint with a tool like Trello made things hard to follow. 
*   Not having a note taker assigned at every meeting. 
*   Not pre-booking collaborative time means last minute scrambles happen
*   Jumping right into writing the playback without thinking about/aligning about what we wanted to say 
*   Using tech that the partner department wasn’t comfortable with added unnecessary awkwardness to the interviews and reduced the amount of conversation. If they’re not familiar with it, at least make sure to teach them how it works first (how to mute and unmute, use the chat etc.) 


### Advice for future sprints



*   Have the Sprint Team spend time together before the sprint!
*   Start with a welcome packet “How to do a sprint” for each team (the onboarding deck).
*   Point out resources available to Sprinters and keep pointing them out. 
*   Read through previous sprint team notes. 
*   Block off the weeks of the sprint as out‐of‐office for non‐sprint meetings. If everyone continues to attend meetings, that means there’s little time that the entire team is in one place and sprinting together, which hurts the sprint more than you might think. Alternatively you can book heads down time in advance. 
*   Set a tone of respect for the people at the target agency. In the Exploration sprint, we are walking into a situation where we are implicitly judging people...and regardless of how they might have been doing at their job, they probably still have been trying and caring. Coming in on a high horse is extremely dangerous. Not acknowledging and respecting the historical effort + good intentions is just mean.
*   You are going to be in a high‐pressure situation. Start coordinating with your team members over Slack early now to form the team. Get a feel for who’s the “lead” type, who's the “support” type and if there are any problematic characters. Pushing the team from forming ‐> storming ‐> norming on day 1 is critical.
*   Make sure you have a debrief each day. 
*   Ensure you have multiple forms of connectivity in case you run into tech issues. 
*   Talk to the people/engs/contractors, not the leads. Do it as much as possible. You will get more honesty. Talk to the leads too, but you will do that naturally so no need to place extra emphasis on it.
*   Provide training and government orientation to those brand new to government (but preferably get folks who have government experience/knowledge).
*   Do a little skill‐building/light training of each others’ skill sets in advance so that you're generally familiar with the team's collective expertise.
*   When you’re giving feedback or writing the playback, ask yourself, “Will this help the team?” Beware of things that may come across as kicks in the face, or bringing up things that aren’t news to them.
*   If it’s sensitive, have a conversation in person.
*   Note the exceptional people you meet along the way, and mention them, where appropriate, to higher ups as folks who helped the sprint succeed.
*   Everyone is a designer. Give people permission and an opportunity to get their ideas heard when you meet with them.
*   Resist making the sprint team larger than 3‐5 people. 
*   Make sure to touch base with the Head of Business Development during the sprint, they work with the partner prior to the sprint so they have useful context to help frame things. 
*   Have team members from past Explorations on the team to help compare and contrast. 
*   Post COVID 
    *   If travel is likely, make sure team members are set up for that, and factor in time for approvals.
    *   Bring your own AV connectivity: cables appropriate for your laptop to connect to projectors and a remote control to advance slides. 
    *   Ensure you have multiple forms of connectivity. Not all buildings will have cell. 

 


## Appendix B: Roles & Responsibilities Matrix

This table is meant to be a suggestion. It’s recommended that you review with the sprint team at the beginning of the Exploration to identify if folks want to take one some of the roles.
